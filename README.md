# BigBrotherAnalytics

An AI-Assisted Intelligent Meaning Making Platform for the Markets

## Overview

BigBrotherAnalytics is a comprehensive, AI-powered trading analysis and decision-making platform that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze market dynamics, identify trading opportunities, and execute strategic investment decisions. The system integrates multiple data sources, performs sophisticated correlation analysis, and employs intelligent trading strategies across different time horizons.

## Project Structure

This repository contains three integrated sub-projects:

### 1. Market Intelligence & Impact Analysis Engine

A sophisticated machine learning system that analyzes and synthesizes information from multiple sources to predict market impacts:

- **Real-time news analysis** - Corporate announcements, breaking news, media sentiment
- **Market data analysis** - Trading volume, price movements, market depth, volatility patterns
- **Legal & regulatory intelligence** - Legal proceedings, regulatory decisions, compliance changes
- **Geopolitical event monitoring** - International relations, trade policies, political decisions
- **Corporate actions tracking** - Mergers, acquisitions, dividends, stock splits, earnings
- **Macroeconomic indicators** - Federal Reserve announcements, interest rate movements and timing
- **Political intelligence** - Supreme Court decisions, trade decisions, political policy changes
- **Seasonal patterns** - Holiday timing, market sentiment during seasonal periods
- **Retail intelligence** - Product sales data from major retailers (Costco, Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy)
- **Impact graph generation** - Identifies affected companies and quantifies impact strength through relationship networks

### 2. Trading Correlation Analysis Tool

A time-series analysis system that discovers relationships between securities using historical data:

- **Historical market data analysis** - Price movements, volume patterns, volatility relationships
- **Historical news correlation** - News event impact on stock movements
- **Multi-timeframe correlation analysis**:
  - Intra-day correlations (minute-by-minute, hourly)
  - Inter-day correlations (daily within week)
  - Intra-month correlations (weekly patterns)
  - Intra-quarter correlations (monthly patterns)
- **Time-lagged convolution analysis** - Identifying leading and lagging indicators
- **Positive and negative correlation identification** - Direct and inverse relationships

### 3. Intelligent Trading Decision Engine

A machine learning system that synthesizes insights from the previous two sub-projects to make trading decisions:

- **Stock selection engine** - Identifies opportunities based on impact analysis and correlations
- **Profit opportunity identification** - Exploits sentiment, news, geopolitical events, and causal chains
- **Movement prediction** - Quantitative forecasts of potential stock price changes
- **Multi-strategy execution**:
  1. **Algorithmic Day Trading** - Fully automated intra-day trading
  2. **Short-term Trading** - Positions held up to 120 days
  3. **Long-term Strategic Investing** - Multi-year investment positions

## Development Philosophy

This project prioritizes thorough planning and iterative refinement. We will:

1. Begin with comprehensive requirements documentation
2. Iterate on features and specifications until requirements are finalized
3. Design system architecture and data flows
4. Implement incrementally with continuous validation
5. Test thoroughly at each stage

## Current Status

**Phase: Planning & Requirements Gathering**

We are currently in the planning phase. No code implementation has begun. The focus is on:
- Defining detailed product requirements
- Identifying data sources and acquisition strategies
- Designing system architecture
- Planning machine learning approaches
- Establishing evaluation metrics and success criteria

## Documentation

- [Product Requirements Document](./docs/PRD.md) - Comprehensive specification of features, requirements, and system design

## Future Roadmap

Detailed roadmap will be developed during the requirements phase and will include:
- Data acquisition and integration strategies
- Machine learning model development and training
- System architecture implementation
- Backtesting framework
- Risk management systems
- Deployment and monitoring infrastructure
