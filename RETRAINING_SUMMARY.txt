PRICE PREDICTION NEURAL NETWORK - RETRAINING COMPLETE
================================================================================
Date: November 13, 2025
Model: price_predictor_60feat_best.pth
Architecture: 60 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 → 3 (58,947 parameters)

SUMMARY:
  Old Model: 51-56% accuracy (buggy training, 44 zero features)
  New Model: 53.0% accuracy (proper training, but 13 constant features)
  Target:    >70% accuracy
  Status:    ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS

ACHIEVEMENTS:
  ✅ Fixed extreme predictions bug (-63003% eliminated)
  ✅ Fixed feature normalization (treasury rates now correct)
  ✅ Fixed feature collection (16→47 effective features)
  ✅ Weights exported in C++ compatible format (10 .bin files)
  ✅ Scaler parameters saved (scaler_params.json)
  ✅ Inference pipeline validated and working
  ❌ Accuracy below target (53% vs 70%)

ROOT CAUSE OF LOW ACCURACY:
  13 constant features (21.7% of model capacity wasted)
  - 4 sentiment features (all zero - no sentiment data)
  - 2 treasury rates (constant - not historical)
  - 3 time features (constant - all data from 21:00)
  - 4 other features (no variation in training data)

TEST SET PERFORMANCE:
  1-Day:  RMSE 2.60% | Directional Accuracy 53.0%
  5-Day:  RMSE 5.20% | Directional Accuracy 44.9%
  20-Day: RMSE 8.73% | Directional Accuracy 60.6%

SAMPLE PREDICTIONS:
  Pred: 0.52% | Actual: 0.45% | Direction: MATCH
  Pred: 0.19% | Actual: -0.28% | Direction: MISS
  Pred: 0.65% | Actual: -0.61% | Direction: MISS
  Pred: 1.13% | Actual: -0.29% | Direction: MISS

C++ INTEGRATION: ⚠️ READY (with caveats)
  [✅] Weights exported (10 .bin files)
  [✅] Scaler parameters saved
  [✅] Architecture matches (60→256→128→64→32→3)
  [✅] No extreme predictions
  [❌] Accuracy below trading threshold (53% < 70%)

  Model CAN be integrated into C++ and will produce reasonable predictions,
  but accuracy is too low for profitable trading.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO ACHIEVE 70% ACCURACY:

1. Quick Wins (Expected: 60-65% accuracy):
   - Remove 13 constant features
   - Fix treasury rate collection (get actual historical rates)
   - Fix time-of-day features (collect from multiple hours)
   - Retrain with 47→256→128→64→32→3 architecture

2. Full Solution (Expected: 70%+ accuracy):
   - All quick wins above
   - Add real sentiment/news data
   - Collect 50K+ training samples (vs current 17K)
   - Feature engineering (relative to market features)
   - Longer training (current stopped at epoch 1)
   - Hyperparameter tuning

COMMANDS:
  Train:    uv run python scripts/ml/train_price_predictor_60features.py
  Export:   uv run python scripts/ml/export_trained_weights.py
  Validate: uv run python scripts/ml/validate_60feat_model.py
